Breaking It Down:
Understanding the Input

The number is stored as a continuous string without spaces.
It spans multiple lines but should be treated as a single sequence of digits.
The Goal

Find 13 consecutive digits in this string that, when multiplied together, produce the highest possible product.
Reference Example (Given in the Prompt)

The prompt demonstrates this concept with four adjacent digits:
9 * 9 * 8 * 9 = 5832 (this is just an example, not part of the solution).
Instead of 4, you now need to find the maximum product for 13 adjacent digits.
Expected Output

A single integer value, which is the highest product found.
Key Constraints & Considerations:
Window of 13 digits: You slide through the string, considering each 13-digit window at a time.
Avoid leading zeros: If a window contains 0, its product is 0, so you can skip ahead.
Efficiency: Since there are 1000 digits, there are 1000 - 13 + 1 = 988 possible windows to check.

Me:

so if I get the first group of thirteen, find its product, 
move to the next group of thirteen, compare its product to 
the previous one and either replacing or keep the previous 
product, and continuing to the end of the string the 
problem will be solved?

GPT:

Yes, that’s exactly the right approach! Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of your process:

Start with the first group of 13 digits, compute its product, and store it as the maximum product so far.
Move to the next group by shifting one digit to the right (i.e., a sliding window approach).
Compute the new product, compare it to the previous maximum:
If it’s larger, update the maximum.
Otherwise, keep the previous maximum.
Repeat until the end of the string is reached.
Optimization Consideration
Instead of recalculating the product from scratch every time:

If the previous digit (the one dropping out of the window) was zero, recalculate the full product from scratch.
Otherwise, divide the previous product by the outgoing digit and multiply by the new digit entering the window.
This reduces redundant calculations and makes your solution more efficient.

Final Result
At the end of the loop, the stored maximum product is the answer.

You're thinking about it correctly—implementing it in this structured way will solve the problem efficiently!
